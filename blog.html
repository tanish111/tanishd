        <h3 class="blog-post-title">The Phantom Project of Google Summer of Code: My Journey Beyond the Recognition and Stipend</h3>
        
        <div class="blog-post-content">
          <p>In May 2025, I faced one of the toughest choices of my student life. I had been selected for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) to work on QEMU, one of the most critical open-source projects powering modern cloud providers. But just days before the program began, I discovered that my campus internship rules at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wouldn't allow any "second job"—even an open-source initiative. The legal department made it clear: continuing with GSoC could mean a policy violation.</p>

          <p>That left me with two choices: withdraw from GSoC completely, losing the project, mentorship, and Google's stipend, or walk away from the "official" program but still contribute out of sheer passion. I chose the second. I wrote to my mentor, Paolo Bonzini, explaining that I wanted to continue unpaid, just to complete the work. His response was simple but powerful: "Yes, of course you can. It's a pity that you won't get paid, but I guess it's a contribution you can put on your CV."</p>

          <p>And that's how my phantom project began—outside the GSoC framework, but with the same rigor, same weekly calls, and even more freedom. Over the summer of 2025, I built and upstreamed patches that reshaped QEMU's tracing infrastructure:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rust Tracing Backend:</strong> I built the entire Rust tracing infrastructure for QEMU by extending its tracetool. This enabled tracepoints for Rust-based device models like the PL011 UART and added support for the most widely used tracing backends — SimpleTrace, Syslog, Log, and Ftrace. This means future QEMU developers can write devices in Rust and still get full tracing capabilities, seamlessly integrating with existing workflows — a step toward safer systems programming in one of the most widely used virtualization platforms.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform Improvements:</strong> I contributed performance patches that improved macOS build stability and simplified backend generation.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Optimized SimpleTrace:</strong> By removing six redundant assembly instructions per tracepoint, I made QEMU's tracing faster and more efficient.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These contributions may sound niche, but for developers building cloud infrastructure, they make day-to-day debugging and performance tuning more reliable. In a way, this work became the backbone of my technical identity: contributing to the backbone of the cloud itself.</p>

          <p>Looking back, not having the "Google" tag or stipend never felt like a loss. If anything, it made me double down on why I was doing this in the first place: not for the line on my résumé, but for the love of open source and the thrill of building something that thousands of developers will use for years.</p>

          <p>That's why I call it The Phantom Project of GSoC: invisible to Google's official records, but very real in its impact on me—and, I hope, on QEMU.</p>
